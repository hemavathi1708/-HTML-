    <h3>Important Technology Terms- Definition List</h3>
    
       <h4><dt title="AI">Artificial Intelligence: </dt></h4>
        <dd>Artificial Intelligence is a technology that enables machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. It allows computers to learn 
           from data, recognize patterns, and make decisions. AI is used in voice assistants, recommendation systems, and self-driving cars.
           It improves efficiency and automation in many industries. AI continues to grow rapidly and is shaping the future of technology.</dd>
           <br>
       <h4><dt>Blockchain Technology:</dt></h4>
       <dd>Blockchain is a secure and decentralized digital record-keeping system. It stores data in blocks that are connected in a chain.
         Once information is added, it cannot be easily changed or deleted. Blockchain is widely used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. 
         It increases transparency, security, and trust in digital transactions.</dd>
         <br>
       <h4><dt>Cloud Computing:</dt></h4>
       
       <dd>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. It allows users to store data and run applications without
         using local storage. Services like Google Drive and online streaming platforms use cloud technology. It provides flexibility, scalability, 
         and cost efficiency. Businesses use cloud computing to manage data securely and access it from anywhere.</dd>
         <br>
         <h4><dt>Internet of Things (IoT):</dt></h4>
       
       <dd>The Internet of Things refers to a network of smart devices connected through the internet. These devices collect 
        and share data automatically. Examples include smart watches, smart home systems, and connected cars. IoT improves automation
         and real-time monitoring. It is widely used in healthcare, agriculture, and smart cities.</dd>
         <br>
         <h4><dt>Cyber Security:</dt></h4>
       
       <dd>Cyber security is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks.
         It prevents unauthorized access, data theft, and damage. Strong passwords, firewalls, and encryption 
         are part of cyber security measures. It is important for individuals, businesses, and governments. Cyber security helps maintain privacy and safe online communication.</dd>
         <br>
         <h4><dt>Robotics:</dt></h4>
      
       <dd>Robotics is the branch of technology that deals with designing and building robots. Robots are machines that can perform tasks automatically or with minimal human control.
         They are used in industries, healthcare, and space exploration. Robotics improves precision and efficiency in complex tasks. It combines engineering, programming, and artificial intelligence.</dd>
